Introduction:
This fan-made tribute site celebrates the raw power, cultural influence, and timeless music of Rock 'n' Roll. 
From legendary bands to iconic albums, this site honors the best in rock music history through curated content,

Pages:
1. Home – Hero image, album carousel, site overview
2. Legends – Bootstrap cards featuring iconic artists

4. Join Us – Signup form for fans
5. External JS File – Includes simulated interactivity with functions for email validation, trivia, lyrics, and more
6. Custom CSS styling - Includes specific stylings for elements

Bootstrap:
Many bootstrap components were used in this project including cards, a carousel, responsive tables, forms, and nav bar.
Bootstrap also helped immensly in formatting the page to fit smaller screens.

JavaScript Functions:
1. A character count function would be used for the form on the top tracks page in order to set a max character limit for the message.
2. A function to validate that certain elements are present for the email section on the join us form.
3. A function to generate a random lyric would be used on the home page as a fun addition and an interactive
    element for users.
4. A function very similar to the one above, but used to generate a random rock n roll trivia question. Also would
    be placed on the home page for user interaction.
5. A function to place the correct date on the page, would be placed either on the home page or possibly as 
    an element in the nav bar.
